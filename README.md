Contact Document Explainer (Invoice/Contact Info Parser)
Prepared by: MANOJ SINGH BISHT
Date: [25/June/2025]

üìå Objective
To develop an AI tool that processes unstructured contact documents (e.g., invoice PDFs, email threads, scanned letters) and extracts:
Contact details (name, company, role), phone numbers, emails, addresses (billing/shipping), contextual notes, and structured data.

üß± System Architecture

PDF/Text Input ‚ûù OCR (if scanned) ‚ûù Preprocessing ‚ûù LLM-based Information Extraction ‚ûù JSON Output

üß© Components & Implementation
1. Input Handling
Supports .pdf, .txt, and OCR on images/scanned documents
Integration with Google Colab or local directory
2. Text Preprocessing
Cleans document text (removes headers/footers, noise)
Splits into paragraphs for context-aware extraction
3. Information Extraction Engine
LLM used: OpenAI GPT-4-turbo or Mistral (depending on config)
Prompt-based parsing for entities like:
oName
oEmail
oPhone number
oCompany
oDesignation
oBilling & shipping addresses
oAny instructions/queries
4. Output Format
ÔÇ∑JSON dictionary containing structured fields
ÔÇ∑Can be exported as:
o.json for integration
o.csv for tabular review
o.txt summary report
5. Fallback Extraction
ÔÇ∑Regex-based parser for key fields:
oEmail
oPhone
oNames (via capitalized patterns)
ÔÇ∑Triggered if LLM fails or returns incomplete results
6. Security & Privacy
ÔÇ∑No data storage ‚Äî all parsing is done in memory
ÔÇ∑Can be integrated with AES-256 encryption pipeline from previous project

üß† Example Prompt Used
text
CopyEdit
You are an intelligent assistant that extracts contact information from business documents. Return results in a structured JSON format with the following keys: name, email, phone, company, role, billing_address, shipping_address, message_context.

üßæ Final Notes
ÔÇ∑Fully functional prototype notebook for document understanding
ÔÇ∑Can be integrated into MSME or legal CRM tools
ÔÇ∑Compatible with the existing encryption + summarization modules
